                Street art is a form of art created in public locations, typically unsanctioned and outside traditional art venues such as walls. It includes a variety of styles such as graffiti, murals, stencils and stickers. Often bold and expressive, street art is used to communicate messages, reflect social and political issues, or simply to add creativity to urban spaces. While it began as an underground movement, street art has gained widespread popularity and now influencess contemporary art and pop culture.

                Street art originated from slogans of protest of political issues through graffiti on walls. This would later evolve into the artistic aspects of street art today. Other examples of early street art can be found in ‘Kilroy was here’ which was thought to be one of the earliest memes. ‘Kilroy was here’ was painted by many allied soldiers in WWII to claim areas that they had liberated. The mid 20th century saw an evolution into its modern form today with New York’s graffiti boom from walls even spreading to the subway cars. Street art would transform from being merely text based to visually conceptual art.

                The switch to visual conceptual art led to many street artists gaining fame and popularity as their works gained attention. Murals became synonymous with the image of cities such as New York, as many took to the streets to give their own spin of street art. This would lead to an acceptance of street art by corporations with some street artists hired to create modern advertisements. The popularity of street art reached a governmental level as former president Obama commissioned a mural of himself to aid his election campaign.
